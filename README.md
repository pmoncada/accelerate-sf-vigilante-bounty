## Problem Statement

Reduce the amount of shit on the streets of San Francisco through a vigilante bounty system.

## Solution

The proposed solution has three main parts:

- A method of identification of shit, creating a bounty.
- A method of direct financing to clean the shit.
- A method of validating the cleaning and receiving payment.


## Adding Shit

A simple web interface would allow users to take a photo of the shit and use the phone's location to plot it on the map.

The users could immediately clean the shit, or leave it as a bounty for someone else.

If immediately cleaned they would get a retroactive reward upon validation.

## Viewing Shit

A poop-dashboard viewer would allow users to walk around the city and clean shit and receive the bounty rewards.

Users can also donate to the site and their contribution would be evenly distributed to the currently active open bounties.

## Cleaning Shit

If the user cleans the shit they submit a photo of the cleaned site, sending it for validation.

## Validating Shit

An administrator would make sure the evidence is properly submitted and there wasn't a fraudulent poop submitted.

If validated, the person who cleaned the shit would receive the payment.

## Shitcoin

To finance the shit bounties the SF community could launch an ERC-20 shitcoin. Donations are routed to a DEX pool to purchase shitcoin, and rewards are distributed in shitcoin for cleaning shits.

This creates a free market incentive for people to speculate on shitcoins with the added benefit of cleaning up the streets of San Francisco.
