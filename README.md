# accelerate-sf-vigilante-bounty

## Problem Statement

Reduce the amount of shit on the streets of San Francisco through a vigilante bounty system.

## Solution

The proposed solution has three main parts:

1.) A method of identification of human shit.
2.) A method of bounty creation and direct financing to solve the problem.
3.) A method of validating the cleaning and receiving payment.


## Adding Shit

A simple web interface would allow users to take a photo of the shit and use the phone's location to plot it on the map.

The users could immediately clean the shit, or leave it as a bounty for someone else.

If immediately cleaned they would get a retroactive reward upon validation.

## Viewing Shit

A poop-dashboard viewer would allow users to walk around the city and clean shit and receive the bounty rewards.

Users can also donate to the site and their contribution would be evenly distributed to the currently active open bounties.

## Cleaning Shit

If the user cleans the shit they submit a photo of the cleaned site, by submitting photographic evidence.

## Validating Shit

An administrator would make sure the evidence is properly submitted and there wasn't an fraudulent poop submitted.
